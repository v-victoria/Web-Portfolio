            <p>
              <strong>Oil paint</strong> is a type of slow-drying paint that
              consists of particles of pigment suspended in a drying oil,
              commonly linseed oil. The viscosity of the paint may be modified
              by the addition of a solvent such as turpentine or white spirit,
              and varnish may be added to increase the glossiness of the dried
              oil paint film. Oil paints were first used in Asia as early as the
              7th century AD and can be seen in examples of Buddhist paintings
              in Afghanistan. Oil-based paints made their way to Europe by the
              12th century and were used for simple decoration, but oil painting
              did not begin to be adopted as an artistic medium there until the
              early 15th century. Common modern applications of oil paint are in
              finishing and protection of wood in buildings and exposed metal
              structures such as ships and bridges. Its hard-wearing properties
              and luminous colors make it desirable for both interior and
              exterior use on wood and metal. Due to its slow-drying properties,
              it has recently been used in paint-on-glass animation. The
              thickness of the coat has considerable bearing on the time
              required for drying: thin coats of oil paint dry relatively
              quickly.

          <div id="histori_info">
            <h3>History</h3>
            <p>
              The technical history of the introduction and development of oil
              paint, and the date of introduction of various additives (driers,
              thinners) is stillâ€”despite intense research since the mid 19th
              centuryâ€”not well understood. The literature abounds with incorrect
              theories and information: in general, anything published before
              1952 is suspect. Until 1991 nothing was known about the organic
              aspect of cave paintings from the Paleolithic era. Many
              assumptions were made about the chemistry of the binders. Well
              known Dutch-American artist Willem de Kooning is known for saying
              "Flesh is the reason oil paint was invented".
              <em class="em-block">First recorded use</em>
              The oldest known oil paintings are Buddhist murals created circa
              650 AD. The works are located in cave-like rooms carved from the
              cliffs of Afghanistan's Bamiyan Valley, "using walnut and poppy
              seed oils."
              <em class="em-block">Classical and medieval period</em>
              Though the ancient Mediterranean civilizations of Greece, Rome,
              and Egypt used vegetable oils, there is little evidence to
              indicate their use as media in painting. Indeed, linseed oil was
              not used as a medium because of its tendency to dry very slowly,
              darken, and crack, unlike mastic and wax (the latter of which was
              used in encaustic painting). Greek writers such as Aetius Amidenus
              recorded recipes involving the use of oils for drying, such as
              walnut, poppy, hempseed, pine nut, castor, and linseed. When
              thickened, the oils became resinous and could be used as varnish
              to seal and protect paintings from water. Additionally, when
              yellow pigment was added to oil, it could be spread over tin foil
              as a less expensive alternative to gold leaf. Early Christian
              monks maintained these records and used the techniques in their
              own artworks. Theophilus Presbyter, a 12th-century German monk,
              recommended linseed oil but advocated against the use of olive oil
              due to its long drying time. Oil paint was mainly used as it is
              today in house decoration, as a tough waterproof cover for exposed
              woodwork, especially outdoors. In the 13th century, oil was used
              to detail tempera paintings. In the 14th century, Cennino Cennini
              described a painting technique utilizing tempera painting covered
              by light layers of oil. The slow-drying properties of organic oils
              were commonly known to early painters. However, the difficulty in
              acquiring and working the materials meant that they were rarely
              used (and indeed the slow drying was seen as a disadvantage).

            <h3>Sources</h3>
            <p>
              The earliest and still most commonly used vehicle is
              <strong>linseed oil</strong>, pressed from the seed of the flax
              plant. Modern processes use heat or steam to produce refined
              varieties of oil with fewer impurities, but many artists prefer
              cold-pressed oils. Other vegetable oils such as hemp, poppy seed,
              walnut, sunflower, safflower, and soybean oils may be used as
              alternatives to linseed oil for a variety of reasons. For example,
              safflower and poppy oils are paler than linseed oil and allow for
              more vibrant whites straight from the tube.

            <h3>Extraction methods and processing</h3>
            <p>
              Once the oil is extracted, additives are sometimes used to modify
              its chemical properties. In this way, the paint can be made to dry
              more quickly (if that is desired), or to have varying levels of
              gloss, like Liquin. Modern oils paints can, therefore, have
              complex chemical structures; for example, affecting resistance to
              UV. By hand, the process involves first mixing the paint pigment
              with the linseed oil to a crumbly mass on a glass or marble slab.
              Then, a small amount at a time is ground between the slab and a
              glass Muller (a round, flat-bottomed glass instrument with a
              handgrip). Pigment and oil are ground together 'with patience'
              until a smooth, ultra-fine paste is achieved. This paste is then
              placed into jars or metal paint tubes and labeled.

          <div id="pigment_info">
            <h3>Pigment</h3>
            <p>
              The color of oil paint is derived from small particles of colored
              pigments mixed with the carrier, the oil. Common pigment types
              include mineral salts such as white oxides: zinc oxide, titanium
              dioxide, and the red to yellow cadmium pigments. Another class
              consists of earth types, the main ones being ochre, sienna and
              umber. Still another group of pigments comes from living
              organisms, such as madder root. Synthetic organic pigments are
              also now available. Natural pigments have the advantage of being
              well understood through centuries of use, but synthetics have
              greatly increased the spectrum of available colors, and many have
              attained a high level of lightfastness. When oil paint was first
              introduced in the arts, basically the same limited range of
              available pigments were used that had already been applied in
              tempera: yellow ochre, umber, lead-tin-yellow, vermilion, kermes,
              azurite, ultramarine, verdigris, lamp black and lead white. These
              pigments strongly varied in price, transparency, and
              lightfastness. They included both inorganic and organic
              substances, the latter often being far less permanent. The painter
              bought them from specialized traders, "color men", and let his
              apprentices grind them with oil in his studio to obtain paint of
              the desired viscosity. During the Age of discovery, new pigments
              became known in Europe, most of the organic and earthy type, such
              as Indian yellow. In the eighteenth century, the developing
              science of chemistry deliberately tried to expand the range of
              pigments, which led to the discovery of Prussian blue and cobalt
              blue.
